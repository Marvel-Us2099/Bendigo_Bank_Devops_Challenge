This project intended to provide the user with access to key information about the team they support, 
delivering an in-depth breakdown of stats in a way that provides key insight into the users team as 
well as rival teams. 

Unfortunately due to Nodejs being a new endeavour for me, it took time to learn the basics, 
and it was difficult to accomplish the feats I was striving for with this project in the time I had. 

I would have liked to have been able to extract and filter queries from the JSON files of data, 
to enable usable data to be presented to the user (Ladder, Wins/losses tally, home game winns and away losses e.g.) 
However, my inexperience heald me back. 

I attempted to integrate a docker file, however that is new to me also, and as I work in 
WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) version 1 there was a bit of work to convert my system to version 2 to enable docker to run. 
I had docker mostly integrated into my project, but once again due to my inexperience with docker 
I was unsure how to tie it off, so I removed the confusion.


The presenter application does:
- return Status 200.
- return Latest Git Commit Hash.
- return Aplication Name and Version.
- Come with Nodenom for quick and easy updates and auto server restart. 


Future Recommendations Section:
- The addition od Docker 
- Data extraction form the json data sets 
- cleaner and more refeined UI/UX for the end user.
